For our direct portfolio, IRR is adopted as our proprietary capital is also used for other activities. As at 31 March 2022, the direct portfolio IRR had increased to c.16%, largely following the successful sale of Faradion.\n\nWe measure 'Total Value to Paid In' ('TVPI') across our Regional and Private Equity ('PE') funds as it shows total value returned and accruing to investors after fees; this naturally increases over time as more capital is returned and the portfolio values grow. Our legacy Venture funds, at a TVPI of 193%, are significantly up year on year as a number of assets were sold at higher values during FY22. Our newest PE fund saw a recovery in asset values as the impact of the pandemic on its portfolio businesses began to recede.\n\nFor our VCTs, 'total return' includes cumulative dividends paid alongside current asset value to give a true total performance measure. It has been principally flat year on year due to sharp price weakness across the listed part of the VCT portfolios in the final quarter of the financial year.\n\nOur strong overall investment performance enables us to raise additional funds, and we were allocated a further £31.4million this financial year from additional contributions to the Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund ('NPIF') Equity and Debt funds and our Midlands Engine Investment Fund ('MEIF') Proof of Concept and Early Stage Fund by BBB. Alongside this, our Enterprise Investment Scheme ('EIS') team raised new funds totalling c.£16million, in addition to Northern VCT investors re-investing c.£6million of dividends paid during the year. Since year end, £40.0million of new funds were raised by our Northern VCTs, together with c.£5million raised by our first Knowledge-intensive Impact EIS Fund. At the year end, we had c.£297million of liquidity across all our funds and balance sheet.\n\n\n| Asset class         |   AuM   1 April 2021  £'m | Private Investor inflows  £'m   | Public Sector inflows  £'m   | Performance  £'m   | Distributions  £'m   |   AuM   31 March 2022  £'m | Post  year end  inflows  £'m   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Venture             |                       600 | 22                              | 20                           | 30                 | (80)                 |                        592 | 45                             |\n| Private Equity      |                        54 | -                               | -                            | (2)                | (4)                  |                         48 | -                              |\n| Debt                |                       110 | -                               | 11                           | -                  | (3)                  |                        118 | -                              |\n| Total FuM           |                       764 | 22                              | 31                           | 28                 | (87)                 |                        758 | 45                             |\n| Proprietary Capital |                       176 | -                               | -                            | 28                 | (3)                  |                        201 | -                              |\n| Total AuM           |                       940 | 22                              | 31                           | 56                 | (90)                 |                        959 | 45                             |"

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Mercia Asset Management PLC mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. To answer this, we need to look for explicit references to mergers, acquisitions, or related activities such as purchases of companies, integration of new businesses, or similar transactions.\n3. Reviewing the provided pages, there is no direct mention of completed mergers or acquisitions. Page 9 discusses strategic objectives, including increasing funds under management through 'fund mandates, fund raising activities and mergers and acquisitions (M&A),' but this appears to refer to a goal rather than an actual event.\n4. Similarly, other sections focus on financial performance, dividend policies, risk management, and operations but do not provide evidence of specific mergers or acquisitions being executed during the reporting period.\n5. The absence of concrete details about executed mergers or acquisitions suggests that none were formally announced or completed in the annual report."

OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nThe presentation of the Group's operating segments reflects information provided internally to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. He analyses the management reports in order to assess performances and allocate resources to the various operating segments.\n\nThe Group's internal organisation and management structure is based on a geographical approach. Management information is grouped into three geographic regions - Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific - and comprises broadly similar products and services. The geographical approach is based mainly on the location of the Group's offices and operating teams.\n\nSegment performance is assessed and resource allocation is decided on the basis of an evaluation of the operating results, which differ in certain respects from the operating result presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nThe accounting policies applied in evaluating the segment operating results are identical to those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n- Segment reporting on joint ventures includes the Group's share in the assets, liabilities, revenue -and results of these companies.\n- Revenue from matched principal activities is recognised at the transaction date instead of the -delivery date of securities.\n- Interest expense recognised on lease liabilities is presented under rental expense and -recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n\nCertain operating expenses related to the Group's holding companies are presented separately from the operating segments. Moreover, some items considered exceptional, such as gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries or associates, depreciation of property and equipment, or restructuring charges, are not included in operating segment results.\n\nRevenues generated by operating segments are derived from three major products groups, which present broadly similar profitability profiles or transaction methods. All Compagnie Financière Tradition's historical broking activities, in the money markets, spot and forward forex trading, interest rate derivatives and currency options, are grouped under 'Currencies and interest rates'. 'Securities and security derivatives' include interest rate futures operations, sovereign and corporate bond trading, equities and equity derivatives trading in OTC and regulated markets, repo transactions, and credit derivatives broking. Finally, 'Commodities and other activities' comprises broking activities in energy, precious metals and environmental products, as well as activities catering to retail customers via specialised forex trading platforms in Asia.\n\nRevenue only includes income from transactions with external customers. No transactions between operating segments impact revenue.\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

It prepares the annual budget, which is then presented to the Board of Directors for approval, and ensures that it is complied with and monitored as part of the regional operations management. Biographical details of each of the Executive Committee members, including their education, career history, and positions within Compagnie Financière Tradition SA are disclosed on pages 33 and 34.\n\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nMembers of the Executive Board do not hold any other positions in governing or supervisory bodies of major Swiss or foreign, private or public corporations, foundations or institutions. They do not exercise any management or advisory functions on behalf of major Swiss or foreign interest groups, and do not hold any official position or political office.\n\nThere were no management contracts between Compagnie Financière Tradition SA and any companies or persons outside the Group at 31 December 2022.\n\n\n## SHAREHOLDINGS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS\n\nPursuant to Article 663c(3) CO, shareholdings in the Company, conversion rights and share options held by Directors and Executive Board members and others in a close relationship with them at 31 December 2022 are disclosed from page 140 to 142.\n\n\n## REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBERS\n\nPursuant to Articles 13 et seq. ORAb/VegüV, compensation paid, as well as guarantees, loans, advances or credit granted by Compagnie Financière Tradition SA or any of its subsidiaries, to Directors, Executive Board members, and others in a close relationship with them, are disclosed in the remuneration report from page 148 to 150.\n\n\nUnder Article 30bis of the Articles of Association, Directors and Executive Board members may serve on governing or administrative bodies of legal entities required to be registered with the Swiss Commercial Registry, or with a similar registry abroad, and which are not controlled by the Company or do not control the Company, subject to the following conditions:\n- in Swiss or foreign companies whose shares -are listed on the stock exchange: no more than five appointments;\n- in Swiss or foreign companies whose shares -are not listed on the stock exchange: no more than fifteen appointments;\n- in other entities with an essentially nor-for--profit object: no more than ten appointments."

Operating margin is typically calculated as (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100.\n2. **Context Examination:** The provided pages include financial data in tables, primarily focusing on non-controlling interests, bond issues, provisions, and corporate governance. However, no table explicitly mentions 'Operating Income' or provides a clear value to calculate the operating margin.\n3. **Metric Matching:** None of the retrieved pages provide explicit figures for 'Operating Income' or any breakdown that would allow us to compute the operating margin. The consolidated financial statements and notes do not directly reference this metric either.\n4. **Value Extraction and Adjustment:** Without the necessary components (Operating Income and Revenue explicitly tied to calculating the margin), it is impossible to derive the requested percentage.\n5. **Conclusion:** Given the lack of sufficient information to compute or directly extract the operating margin, the answer must be 'N/A'."

Your management team and all of our YP colleagues continued to strengthen and increase the value of our company, generating strong cash while continuing to make measured and deliberate, productive investments in our future. Notable accomplishments included:\n- · Produced strong profitability. For the year, our profit (measured as Adjusted EBITDA margin 1 ) was 36.0% of revenues, despite our ongoing, productive investments in revenue initiatives.\n- · Cash to Shareholders and to Pension Plan. Pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement, during 2022, we distributed $100.0 million to shareholders by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders on a pro rata basis and advanced $24.0 million of voluntary contributions to our Defined Benefit Pension Plan's wind-up deficit, in addition to our $4.0 million voluntary incremental payments as announced in May 2021 toward our Defined Benefit Pension Plan's wind-up deficit.\n- · Completed NCIB for our common stock. Under our Normal Course Issuer Bid program, launched during 2021, the company purchased 871,135 common shares for cash of $12.4 million during 2022.\n- · Paid quarterly cash dividends. We continued to pay dividends of 15 cents per common share per quarter, for a total of $14.2 million in dividends to our common shareholders during 2022.\n- · Healthy cash balance. Even after the significant disbursements to shareholders and the Pension Plan, and continued investment in our revenue initiatives, we ended the year with approximately $43.9 million in cash.\n- · Closer to revenue stability. Every quarter in 2022, our percent change in revenue over prior year was better than the previous quarter's, and on an annual basis, total revenue percentage change was over 7 percentage points better than reported for 2021.\n\n\nWe believe we have produced strong results and continued to advance our company along a promising course for the future.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nDavid A. Eckert President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n- (1) Adjusted EBITDA is  equal to Income  from operations  before  depreciation  and  amortization  and  restructuring  and  other  charges  (defined  herein  as  Adjusted  EBITDA),  as  shown  in  Yellow  Pages  Limited's consolidated statements of income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA to  revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not performance measures defined under IFRS and are not considered an alternative to income from operations or net earnings in the context of measuring Yellow Pages performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and are therefore not likely to be comparable to similar measures used by other publicly traded companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be used as exclusive measures of cash flow since they do not account for the impact of working capital changes, income taxes, interest payments, pension funding, capital expenditures, debt principal reductions and other sources and uses of cash, which are disclosed on page 20 of our February 14, 2023 MD&A.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to evaluate the performance of its business as it reflects its ongoing profitability. Management believes that certain investors and analysts use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure a company's ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations or as common measurement to value companies in the media and marketing solutions industry as well as to evaluate the performance of a business."

          "chunk_text": "# Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n\n## Share repurchase - Plan of Arrangement\n\nOn August 4, 2022, the Board approved a distribution to shareholders of approximately $100.0 million by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders pursuant to a statutory arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the 'Arrangement'). The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125  common  shares  (including  388,082  shares  held  in  treasury)  at  a  purchase  price  of  $12.58  per  share  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  for  a  total  of $101.0 million,  including  $1.0 million  of  transaction  costs. The  $101.0  million  cash  outlay  was reduced  by  $4.9  million  for the  cancellation  of  388,082  of  YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan's (the 'Pension Plan') wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (refer to ' Pension Contributions ' section for additional details).\n\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nOn May 12 th , 2021, the Company's Board modified its dividend policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common shareholders by increasing the dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.15 per share. YP's dividend payout policy and the declaration of dividends on any of the Company's outstanding common shares are subject to the discretion of the Board and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that the dividend payout policy will be maintained or that dividends will be declared. Dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on YP's operations and financial results, subject to the Board's assessment on a quarterly basis, which are, in turn, subject to various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD&A.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share. The dividends were paid on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of 2022 for a total consideration of $14.2 million to common shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.11 per common share on March 15, 2021 and of $0.15 per common share on June 30, September 15 and December 15 of 2021 for a total consideration of $14.7 million to common shareholders.\n\nOn  February  14,  2023,  the  Board  declared  a  cash  dividend  of  $0.15  per  common  share,  payable  on  March  15,  2023  to  shareholders  of  record  as  at February 24, 2023. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.\n\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\n(in thousands of Canadian dollars)\n\n\n|                                        | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Total                                                    | 1 year                                                   | 2 - 3 years                                              | 4 - 5 years                                              | Thereafter                                               |\n| Lease obligations 1,2                  | $  47,129                                                | $  3,396                                                 | $  7,675                                                 | $  8,137                                                 | $  27,921                                                |\n| Operating portion of lease obligations | 58,036                                                   | 4,961                                                    | 11,193                                                   | 11,535                                                   | 30,347                                                   |\n| Purchase obligations                   | 32,196                                                   | 14,407                                                   | 12,968                                                   | 2,562                                                    | 2,259                                                    |\n| Total contractual obligations          | $  137,361                                               | $  22,764                                                | $  31,836                                                | $  22,234                                                | $  60,527                                                |\n1 Principal amount.\n2 Net present value.\n\n\n\n## Lease obligations\n\nWe entered into finance lease agreements for premises.

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether TSX_Y (Yellow Pages Limited) announced a share buyback plan in the annual report.\n2. A 'share buyback plan' refers to a company's initiative to repurchase its own shares, typically for cancellation or to be held in treasury.\n3. The context mentions two specific instances of share repurchases: \n   - First, an NCIB (Normal Course Issuer Bid) was completed on July 16, 2021, after attaining the $5.0 million limit (page 19). \n   - Second, a new NCIB was announced on August 5, 2021, to purchase up to $16.0 million of outstanding shares for cancellation by August 9, 2022 (page 19). This program was completed on May 30, 2022, with total purchases of 1,122,511 common shares for $16.0 million.\n4. Additionally, under 'Share repurchases - Plan of Arrangement,' the company repurchased 7,949,125 common shares on October 4, 2022, as part of a statutory arrangement (pages 3, 20).\n5. These details confirm that Yellow Pages Limited executed and completed multiple share repurchase initiatives, including both NCIBs and a statutory arrangement.\n6. While these programs were ongoing or completed during the reporting period, there is no explicit mention of a *new* share buyback plan being announced in the 2022 annual report."

          "chunk_text": "# Table of Contents\n\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nHolley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company's geographic  presence,  provide  a  highly  synergistic  opportunity  and/or  enhance  Holley's  ability  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  its  products  to  its customers through its distribution network.\n\n\nFrom  2020  through  2022,  Holley  completed  15  acquisitions.  The  most  significant  of  these  acquisitions  impacting  the  comparability  of  our operating results were:\n- · Baer, Inc. : On December 23, 2021, Holley acquired Baer, Inc. doing business as Baer Brakes, a developer and supplier of brakes and brake systems. This acquisition moves Holley closer to its goals of providing complete vehicle solutions by adding a new product category and brake system expertise.\n- · Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc. : On December 16, 2021, Holley acquired Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., doing business as Brothers Trucks, a distributor of Classic and Custom vehicle restoration parts serving the Chevrolet and GMC truck aftermarket. This acquisition increases Holley's offering in truck and SUV appearance items.\n- · Advance Engine Management Inc. : On April 14, 2021, Holley acquired Advance Engine Management Inc., doing business as AEM Performance  Electronics,  a  developer  and  supplier  of  electronic  control  and  monitoring  systems  for  performance  automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley's penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.\n- · Simpson  Performance  Products: On  November  16,  2020,  Holley  acquired  Simpson  Performance  Products,  Inc.  ('Simpson'),  a designer  and  seller  of  motorsport  safety  products  including  helmets  head  &  neck  restraints,  seat  belts,  fire  suits  and  more.  This acquisition extended Holley's footprint into the safety and racing segment.\n- · Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020, Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC ('Drake'), a designer and seller of automotive  aftermarket  appearance  parts,  wheels,  chassis  &  suspension  products  and  accessories.  This  acquisition  increases Holley's penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.\n\n\nThe  acquisitions  have  all  been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  Accounting  Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805, Business Combinations , and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, ' Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,'  and  Note  2,  ' Business Combination and Acquisitions ,'  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n\n\n## Business Environment\n\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has continued to experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full  extent  of  COVID-19's  effect  on  the  Company's  operational  and  financial  performance  in  the  future  will  depend  on  future  developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.\n\nThe  Company's  business  and  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity  are  impacted  by  broad  economic  conditions  including inflation, labor shortages, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine. The Company's operations have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures primarily related to transportation, labor and component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary impacts, the Company has attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products and working closely with its suppliers and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  The  Company's  profitability  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increased our  costs.  Should  the  ongoing  macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate the impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected."

Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nHolley Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky (the 'Company' or 'Holley'), conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries. These operating subsidiaries are comprised of Holley Performance Products Inc. ('Holley Performance'), Hot Rod Brands, Inc. ('Hot Rod Brands'), Simpson Safety Solutions, Inc., B&M Racing and Performance Products, Inc., and Speedshop.com, Inc.\n\nOn July 16, 2021, (the 'Closing' and such date, the 'Closing Date') the Company consummated the business combination (the 'Business Combination') pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021, (the 'Merger Agreement'), by and among Empower Ltd.,  ('Empower'),  Empower  Merger  Sub  I  Inc.  ('Merger  Sub  I'),  Empower  Merger  Sub  II  LLC  ('Merger  Sub  II'),  and  Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. ('Holley Intermediate'). On the Closing Date, Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. See Note 2, ' Business Combination, Acquisitions, and Divestiture, ' for more information.\n\nHolley Intermediate, the predecessor to Holley, was incorporated on October 25, 2018, to effect the merger of Driven Performance Brands, Inc.  ('Driven')  and  the  purchase  of  High  Performance  Industries,  Inc.  ('HPI').  The  Company  designs,  manufactures  and  distributes performance automotive products to customers primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The Company is a leading manufacturer of  a  diversified  line  of  performance automotive products, including carburetors, fuel pumps, fuel injection systems, nitrous oxide injection systems, superchargers, exhaust headers, mufflers, distributors, ignition components, engine tuners and automotive performance plumbing products that are produced through its two major subsidiaries, Holley Performance and Hot Rod Brands. The Company is also a leading manufacturer  of  exhaust  products  as  well  as  shifters,  converters,  transmission  kits,  transmissions,  tuners  and  automotive  software.  The Company's  products  are  designed  to  enhance  street,  off-road,  recreational  and  competitive  vehicle  performance  through  increased horsepower, torque and drivability. The Company has locations in North America, Canada, Italy and China.\n\n\n## Emerging Growth Company Status\n\nSection  102(b)(1)  of  the  JOBS  Act  exempts  emerging  growth  companies  from  being  required  to  comply  with  new  or  revised  financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company is an emerging growth company, and, as such, has elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards.\n\n\n## Risks and Uncertainties\n\nCOVID-19  has  adversely  impacted  global  supply  chain  and  general  economic  conditions.

          "chunk_text": "# Table of Contents\n\n\n## Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn  October  2021,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2021-08, Business  Combinations  (Topic  805):  Accounting  for  Contract  Assets  and  Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers .  This ASU requires entities to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,  to  recognize  and  measure  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  (i.e.,  deferred  revenue) relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. Under current U.S. GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. Adoption of the provisions of ASU 2021-08 are effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.\n\n\n## 2. BUSINESS COMBINATION, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURE\n\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nOn July 16, 2021, Holley consummated the Business Combination pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, whereby (i) Merger Sub I, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower, merged with and into Holley Intermediate, with Holley Intermediate surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holley ('Merger I') and (ii) Merger Sub II, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower, merged with and into Holley Intermediate, with Merger Sub II surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holley ('Merger II').\n\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Closing, all outstanding shares of Holley Intermediate common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of Merger I were cancelled and the Holley Stockholder, the sole stockholder of Holley Intermediate, received $264,718 in cash and 67,673,884 shares of common stock (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share). The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'HLLY.'\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, a number of subscribers purchased from the Company an aggregate of 24,000,000 shares of common stock (the 'PIPE'), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, or $240,000 in the aggregate. Per the Merger Agreement, $100,000 of the PIPE proceeds were used to partially pay off Holley's debt.\n\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement ('A&R FPA'), at the Closing, 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 1,666,667 warrants were issued to certain investors for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000. Pursuant to the A&R FPA, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the 'Public Warrants'), subject to certain conditions.\n\nThe Company also assumed 8,333,310 Public Warrants and 4,666,667 private placement warrants (the 'Private Warrants', and together with  the  Public  Warrants,  the  'Warrants')  upon  the  Business  Combination,  all  of  which  were  issued  in  connection  with  Empower's  initial public offering. Each Warrant represents the right to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain conditions. The Warrants are exercisable commencing on October 9, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of Empower's initial public offering) and expire on July 16, 2026 (five years after the Closing Date). The Public Warrants are listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'HLLY WS.'\n\nAdditionally, Empower Sponsor Holdings LLC (the \"Sponsor\") received 2,187,500 shares of the Company's common stock, which vest in two equal tranches upon achieving certain market share price milestones as outlined in the Merger Agreement during the earn-out period ('the 'Earn-Out Shares'). The first tranche of Earn-Out Shares vested during the first quarter of 2022. Upon vesting, the first tranche of the EarnOut Shares, or 1,093,750 shares, were issued and a liability of $14,689, representing the fair value of the shares on the date of vesting, was reclassified from liabilities to equity. The remaining tranche of Earn-Out Shares will be forfeited if the applicable conditions are not satisfied before July 16, 2028 (seven years after the Closing Date). The remaining Earn-Out Shares are classified as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at fair value with changes in the post-Business Combination fair value recognized in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income as non-operating expense."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Holley Inc. mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. To determine this, I will look for explicit references to mergers, acquisitions, or related activities such as business combinations.\n3. On page 5, the text mentions the company's '2022 acquisitions of substantially all the assets of John's Ind., Inc. ('John's'), Southern Kentucky Classics ('SKC'), and Vesta Motorsports USA, Inc., d.b.a. RaceQuip ('RaceQuip').' This clearly indicates acquisitions.\n4. Additionally, page 63 discusses the 'Business Combination' involving Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. and Empower Ltd., which is described as a merger transaction. Details about this combination are also provided on pages 56 and 63.\n5. Further, page 34 lists multiple acquisitions completed by Holley from 2020 through 2022, including companies like Baer, Inc., Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., and Advance Engine Management Inc.\n6. These references confirm that Holley Inc. did indeed mention mergers and acquisitions in its annual report."
