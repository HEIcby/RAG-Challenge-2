      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Mercia Asset Management PLC mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. To answer this, I need to look for explicit mentions of 'mergers,' 'acquisitions,' or related activities such as purchases of companies, integration of businesses, or similar transactions.\n3. On page 9, under 'Other key objectives,' there is a mention of increasing funds under management ('FuM') through 'increased fund mandates, fund raising activities and mergers and acquisitions ('M&A').' However, this appears to refer to strategies for growing funds under management rather than actual completed mergers or acquisitions.\n4. No other pages retrieved explicitly mention completed mergers or acquisitions. While M&A is listed as a strategy, there is no evidence of specific transactions being announced or executed during the reporting period.\n5. Therefore, while M&A is discussed as a potential growth avenue, no concrete mergers or acquisitions are detailed in the provided content."

Exceptional costs amounted to CHF 12.9m against CHF 5.8m in the previous year. They included a net amount of CHF 7.9m related to matched principal transactions, as well as brokerage receivables in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and particularly the\n\nprovisions in respect of receivables for unsettled ensuing restrictions and sanctions.\n\nReported operating profit for the year was CHF 94.2m against CHF 73.2m in 2021, an increase of 29.1% at constant exchange rates with an operating margin of 9.9% against 8.4% in the previous year.

The holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive any dividend declared by the Board of the Company on the common shares. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Yellow Pages, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive, after payment of all liabilities of Yellow Pages and subject to the preferential rights of any class of shares of Yellow Pages ranking in priority to the common shares of Yellow Pages, the remaining assets and property of Yellow Pages.\n\nThe total number of common shares of Yellow Pages Limited held by the trustee for the purpose of funding the restricted share unit and performance share unit plan (the 'RSU and PSU Plan') amounted to 910,912 as at December 31, 2022 (see Note 19 ).\n\nUnder the Stock Option Plan, the maximum number of common shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of options is 2,806,932 (see Note 19 ).

Upon completion of this NCIB on July 16, 2021, the Company had purchased 403,220 common shares for cash of $5.0 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company announced a new NCIB commencing August 10, 2021 to purchase up to $16.0 million of the Company's outstanding shares for cancellation on or before August 9, 2022. Upon completion of this NCIB program on May 30, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program, a total of 1,122,511 common shares for cash of $16.0 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 871,135 common shares, for cash of $12.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 251,376 common shares for cash of $3.6 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares in excess of the repurchase proceeds was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, a $0.6 million financial liability with a corresponding amount in equity, was recorded in Trade and other payables on the consolidated statements of financial position in relation with the NCIB. This liability represented  the value of common shares authorized to be repurchased by a designated broker under an automatic share purchase plan from January 1, 2022 to February 11, 2022. This automatic share purchase plan allowed for the purchase of the Company's common shares under pre-set conditions at times when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. These common shares are included in the outstanding common shares as at December 31, 2021. In 2022, there was no liability as the NCIB was completed.\n\n\n## Share repurchases - Plan of Arrangement\n\nOn August 4, 2022, the Board approved a distribution to shareholders of approximately $100.0 million by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders pursuant to a statutory arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022.

The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125  common  shares  (including  388,082  shares  held  in  treasury)  at  a  purchase  price  of  $12.58  per  share  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  for  a  total  of $101.0 million,  including  $1.0 million  of  transaction  costs. The  $101.0  million  cash  outlay  was reduced  by  $4.9  million  for the  cancellation  of  388,082  of  YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan's (the 'Pension Plan') wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (refer to ' Pension Contributions ' section for additional details).\n\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nOn May 12 th , 2021, the Company's Board modified its dividend policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common shareholders by increasing the dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.15 per share. YP's dividend payout policy and the declaration of dividends on any of the Company's outstanding common shares are subject to the discretion of the Board and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that the dividend payout policy will be maintained or that dividends will be declared. Dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on YP's operations and financial results, subject to the Board's assessment on a quarterly basis, which are, in turn, subject to various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD&A.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share. The dividends were paid on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of 2022 for a total consideration of $14.2 million to common shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.11 per common share on March 15, 2021 and of $0.15 per common share on June 30, September 15 and December 15 of 2021 for a total consideration of $14.7 million to common shareholders.\n\nOn  February  14,  2023,  the  Board  declared  a  cash  dividend  of  $0.15  per  common  share,  payable  on  March  15,  2023  to  shareholders  of  record  as  at February 24, 2023. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.\n\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\n(in thousands of Canadian dollars)\n\n\n|                                        | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Total                                                    | 1 year                                                   | 2 - 3 years                                              | 4 - 5 years                                              | Thereafter                                               |\n| Lease obligations 1,2                  | $  47,129                                                | $  3,396                                                 | $  7,675                                                 | $  8,137                                                 | $  27,921                                                |\n| Operating portion of lease obligations | 58,036                                                   | 4,961                                                    | 11,193                                                   | 11,535                                                   | 30,347                                                   |\n| Purchase obligations                   | 32,196                                                   | 14,407                                                   | 12,968                                                   | 2,562                                                    | 2,259                                                    |\n| Total contractual obligations          | $  137,361                                               | $  22,764                                                | $  31,836                                                | $  22,234                                                | $  60,527                                                |\n1 Principal amount.\n2 Net present value.\n\n\n\n## Lease obligations\n\nWe entered into finance lease agreements for premises.

Your management team and all of our YP colleagues continued to strengthen and increase the value of our company, generating strong cash while continuing to make measured and deliberate, productive investments in our future. Notable accomplishments included:\n- · Produced strong profitability. For the year, our profit (measured as Adjusted EBITDA margin 1 ) was 36.0% of revenues, despite our ongoing, productive investments in revenue initiatives.\n- · Cash to Shareholders and to Pension Plan. Pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement, during 2022, we distributed $100.0 million to shareholders by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders on a pro rata basis and advanced $24.0 million of voluntary contributions to our Defined Benefit Pension Plan's wind-up deficit, in addition to our $4.0 million voluntary incremental payments as announced in May 2021 toward our Defined Benefit Pension Plan's wind-up deficit.\n- · Completed NCIB for our common stock. Under our Normal Course Issuer Bid program, launched during 2021, the company purchased 871,135 common shares for cash of $12.4 million during 2022.\n- · Paid quarterly cash dividends. We continued to pay dividends of 15 cents per common share per quarter, for a total of $14.2 million in dividends to our common shareholders during 2022.\n- · Healthy cash balance. Even after the significant disbursements to shareholders and the Pension Plan, and continued investment in our revenue initiatives, we ended the year with approximately $43.9 million in cash.\n- · Closer to revenue stability. Every quarter in 2022, our percent change in revenue over prior year was better than the previous quarter's, and on an annual basis, total revenue percentage change was over 7 percentage points better than reported for 2021.\n\n\nWe believe we have produced strong results and continued to advance our company along a promising course for the future.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nDavid A. Eckert President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n- (1) Adjusted EBITDA is  equal to Income  from operations  before  depreciation  and  amortization  and  restructuring  and  other  charges  (defined  herein  as  Adjusted  EBITDA),  as  shown  in  Yellow  Pages  Limited's consolidated statements of income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA to  revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not performance measures defined under IFRS and are not considered an alternative to income from operations or net earnings in the context of measuring Yellow Pages performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and are therefore not likely to be comparable to similar measures used by other publicly traded companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be used as exclusive measures of cash flow since they do not account for the impact of working capital changes, income taxes, interest payments, pension funding, capital expenditures, debt principal reductions and other sources and uses of cash, which are disclosed on page 20 of our February 14, 2023 MD&A.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to evaluate the performance of its business as it reflects its ongoing profitability. Management believes that certain investors and analysts use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure a company's ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations or as common measurement to value companies in the media and marketing solutions industry as well as to evaluate the performance of a business."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether TSX_Y (Yellow Pages Limited) announced a share buyback plan in the annual report.\n2. A 'share buyback plan' refers to a company's initiative to repurchase its own shares, typically to reduce the number of shares outstanding or return capital to shareholders.\n3. The context mentions two specific types of share repurchases: (a) through Normal Course Issuer Bids (NCIBs) and (b) via a statutory plan of arrangement. Details about both are provided across multiple pages.\n4. On page 68, it states that under an NCIB commencing August 10, 2020, the company purchased shares for cancellation, and another NCIB was announced on August 5, 2021, to purchase up to $16.0 million of shares. This program was completed on May 30, 2022, with purchases totaling $16.0 million.\n5. Additionally, on page 20, the company describes a significant share repurchase event under a 'Plan of Arrangement,' where 7,949,125 common shares were repurchased on October 4, 2022, for $101.0 million.\n6. Both the NCIB and the Plan of Arrangement qualify as share buyback plans, explicitly described in detail in the annual report."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks for the largest single spending of CrossFirst Bank on executive compensation in USD. This would typically involve identifying specific amounts paid to executives as part of their compensation, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, or other benefits.\n2. To answer this, I will review the provided documents for mentions of executive compensation, employment agreements, or any related financial disclosures that might reveal individual payments or significant expenditures.\n3. On page 113, there is a list of exhibits, including employment agreements with executives such as Mike Maddox, Benjamin R. Clouse, Amy Fauss, and others. However, these documents do not specify exact dollar amounts for their compensation.\n4. Page 36 provides details about the roles and backgrounds of key executives, but it does not include specific figures related to their compensation.\n5. Page 65 contains consolidated statements of operations, which include 'Salaries and employee benefits' as an expense category totaling $75,288,000 for 2022. However, this figure represents aggregate spending on all employees rather than individual executive compensation.\n6. There is no explicit mention in the provided pages of a single largest spending amount on executive compensation. Without access to detailed breakdowns of individual executive pay packages, it is impossible to determine the largest single spending based on the available information.\n7. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context."

(\"Holdings\"). The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, the following transactions: (i) Merger Sub I merged with and into Holdings, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I ceased, and Holdings became the surviving corporation, and (ii)  Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub II, the separate corporate existence of Holdings ceased, and Merger Sub II became the surviving  limited  liability  company.

Our aim is to provide a platform where automotive enthusiasts can purchase aftermarket auto parts for both old model restorations and new vehicle enhancements. We believe our consumers are enthusiastic and passionate about the performance and the personalization of their classic and modern cars. We aim to provide the products and service they need to pursue that passion. We will continue to drive growth and value for our shareholders through our key strategies:\n- · Continuous  New  Product  Development: New  products  allow  us  to  increase  market  share  in  existing  categories,  extend  into adjacent categories, capture new enthusiast consumers and extend or further penetrate new vehicle platforms. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -If the Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's new product development.\n- · Accelerate Growth Through Continued M&A : We have historically used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio, enter new product categories and consumer segments, and expand share in current product categories. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that complement our current business and expand our addressable target market. We believe that our scalable business platform, relationships with our distribution and channel partners, strong loyalty with our growing consumer base, and experienced management team and board of directors, position us to realize the benefits from the integration of recent acquisitions and prime us for future acquisitions. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -The Company may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert  the  Company  management s  attention,  result  in  dilution  to  the  Company  stockholders,  and  otherwise  disrupt  the  Company ' operations and harm the Company business, sales, financial condition and results of operations ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's M&A activity.\n- · Expand Direct-to-Consumer ( DTC ) Sales and Further Engage with Our Consumers: ' ' We are highly focused on deepening our engagement with our enthusiast consumers and selling them products through our fast-growing online platform.

The principal factors  on  which  industry  participants  compete  include  technical  features,  performance,  product  design,  innovation,  reliability  and  durability, brand, time to market, customer service, reliable order execution, and price. Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability to execute our Business Strategy discussed above.\n\nThe performance automotive aftermarket parts industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. In addition, we have seen consistent growth within the automotive aftermarket parts industry over the last two decades. Products in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry range from functional products that enhance vehicle performance to products that improve safety, stability, handling and appearance."

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Holley s consolidated financial statements and ' related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause Holley s actual results to differ materially from management s ' ' expectations.  Factors  that  could  cause  such  differences  are  discussed  herein  and  under  the  caption, ' Cautionary  Note  Regarding  ForwardLooking Statements. '\n\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a designer, marketer, and manufacturer of high-performance automotive aftermarket products serving car and truck enthusiasts, with sales,  processing,  and  distribution  facilities  reaching  most  major  markets  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  Europe  and  China.  Holley  designs, markets, manufactures and distributes a diversified line of performance automotive products including fuel injection systems, tuners, exhaust products, carburetors, safety equipment and various other performance automotive products. Our products are designed to enhance street, offroad, recreational and competitive vehicle performance and safety.\n\nInnovation is at the core of our business and growth strategy with approximately 34% of our 2022 sales coming from products introduced by us into the market since 2017. We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing product families, product line expansions, and accessories, as well as products that bring us into new categories. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs.\n\nIn  addition, we have historically used strategic acquisitions to (i) expand our brand portfolio, (ii) enter new product categories and consumer segments, (iii) increase DTC scale and connection, (iv) expand share in current product categories and (v) realize value-enhancing revenue and cost synergies. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that would complement our current business and expand our addressable target market.\n\n\n## Factors Affecting our Performance\n\nWe believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this Form 10-K titled 'Risk Factors.'\n\n\n## Business Combination\n\nOn July 16, 2021, we consummated a business combination ('Business Combination') pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021, (the 'Merger Agreement'), by and among Empower Ltd., ('Empower'), Empower Merger Sub I Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub I'), Empower Merger Sub II LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub II'), and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc.

Upon closing,  Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. and its trading  symbol  on  the  New York  Stock  Exchange  (the  'NYSE')  from  'EMPW'  to 'HLLY.'\n\nThe Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Holdings was deemed the accounting acquirer with Holley Inc. as the successor registrant. As such, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes, and financial statements for periods prior to the Business Combination are those of Holdings.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  Business  Combination,  Holley  Inc.  listed  on  the  NYSE,  which  required  us  to  hire  additional  personnel  and  implement procedures  and  processes  to  address  public  company  regulatory  requirements  and  customary  practices.  We  have  incurred  and  expect  to continue to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors' and officers' liability insurance, director fees, and additional internal and external accounting, legal, and administrative resources, including increased personnel costs, audit and other professional service fees."

          "chunk_text": "# Table of Contents\n\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nHolley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company's geographic  presence,  provide  a  highly  synergistic  opportunity  and/or  enhance  Holley's  ability  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  its  products  to  its customers through its distribution network.\n\n\nFrom  2020  through  2022,  Holley  completed  15  acquisitions.  The  most  significant  of  these  acquisitions  impacting  the  comparability  of  our operating results were:\n- · Baer, Inc. : On December 23, 2021, Holley acquired Baer, Inc. doing business as Baer Brakes, a developer and supplier of brakes and brake systems. This acquisition moves Holley closer to its goals of providing complete vehicle solutions by adding a new product category and brake system expertise.\n- · Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc. : On December 16, 2021, Holley acquired Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., doing business as Brothers Trucks, a distributor of Classic and Custom vehicle restoration parts serving the Chevrolet and GMC truck aftermarket. This acquisition increases Holley's offering in truck and SUV appearance items.\n- · Advance Engine Management Inc. : On April 14, 2021, Holley acquired Advance Engine Management Inc., doing business as AEM Performance  Electronics,  a  developer  and  supplier  of  electronic  control  and  monitoring  systems  for  performance  automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley's penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.\n- · Simpson  Performance  Products: On  November  16,  2020,  Holley  acquired  Simpson  Performance  Products,  Inc.  ('Simpson'),  a designer  and  seller  of  motorsport  safety  products  including  helmets  head  &  neck  restraints,  seat  belts,  fire  suits  and  more.  This acquisition extended Holley's footprint into the safety and racing segment.\n- · Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020, Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC ('Drake'), a designer and seller of automotive  aftermarket  appearance  parts,  wheels,  chassis  &  suspension  products  and  accessories.  This  acquisition  increases Holley's penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.\n\n\nThe  acquisitions  have  all  been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  Accounting  Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805, Business Combinations , and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, ' Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,'  and  Note  2,  ' Business Combination and Acquisitions ,'  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n\n\n## Business Environment\n\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has continued to experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full  extent  of  COVID-19's  effect  on  the  Company's  operational  and  financial  performance  in  the  future  will  depend  on  future  developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.\n\nThe  Company's  business  and  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity  are  impacted  by  broad  economic  conditions  including inflation, labor shortages, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine. The Company's operations have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures primarily related to transportation, labor and component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary impacts, the Company has attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products and working closely with its suppliers and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  The  Company's  profitability  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increased our  costs.  Should  the  ongoing  macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate the impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected."

          "chunk_text": "The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This determination was primarily based  on  the  Holley  Stockholder  having  a  relative  majority  of  the  voting  power  of  the  Company,  the  operations  of  Holley  prior  to  the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Company, and senior management of Holley comprising the majority of the senior management of the Company. Under this method of accounting, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting. Accordingly,  the  Business  Combination  was  accounted  for  as  the  equivalent  of  Holley  issuing  stock  for  the  net  assets  of  Empower, accompanied by a recapitalization. The  net  assets  of  Empower  are  stated  at  historical  cost,  with  no  goodwill  or  other  intangible  assets recorded.  Reported  amounts  from  operations  included  herein  prior  to  the  Business  Combination  are  those  of  Holley  Intermediate.  The shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated based on shares received by the Holley Stockholder.\n\nThe following table reconciles the elements of the Business Combination to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n|                                                                                                  | Recapitalization   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Cash - Empower's trust and cash (net of redemptions of $99,353 and transaction costs of $44,314) | $ 107,017          |\n| Cash - Forward Purchase Agreement                                                                | 50,000             |\n| Cash - PIPE Financing                                                                            | 240,000            |\n| Net cash provided by Business Combination and PIPE Financing                                     | 397,017            |\n| Less: cash consideration paid to Holley Stockholder                                              | (264,718)          |\n| Net contributions from Business Combination and PIPE Financing                                   | $ 132,299          |\n\n\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed 14 acquisitions. These acquisitions are expected to enhance the Company's portfolio of products and services in the automotive aftermarket and automotive safety solutions market.\n\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated based upon the  fair  value  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  The  valuation  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  is  subject  to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, material changes are not expected. Goodwill generated by the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the strong market position of the entities acquired.\n\nPurchase price consideration for all acquisitions was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions were for 100 percent of the acquired business and  are  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  net  of  acquired  cash  and  cash  equivalents. Acquisition-related  costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are typically expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and are recorded in acquisition and restructuring costs. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\nIn 2022, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of John's Ind., Inc. (\"John's\"), Southern Kentucky Classics (\"SKC\"), and Vesta Motorsports USA, Inc., doing business as RaceQuip (\"RaceQuip\"). These acquisitions were immaterial business combinations. Cash paid for the three acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $14,863, and was funded with borrowings from the Company's credit facility and cash on  hand.  The  acquisitions  resulted  in  both  amortizable  and  nonamortizable  intangibles  and  goodwill  totaling  $9,618.  The  goodwill  and intangibles  generated  as  a  result  of  these  acquisitions  are  deductible  for  income  tax  purposes.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  and  the results of operations since the acquisition dates for these immaterial acquisitions have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Holley Inc. mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. To determine this, I will look for explicit references to mergers, acquisitions, or related activities such as business combinations.\n3. On page 6, the report discusses a 'Business Combination' involving Empower Ltd. and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc., which resulted in Empower changing its name to Holley Inc. This is an example of a merger.\n4. Additionally, on pages 33-34, there is extensive discussion about acquisitions completed by Holley from 2020 through 2022, including details on specific companies acquired (e.g., Baer Brakes, Brothers Trucks, AEM Performance Electronics, etc.).\n5. Page 64 further elaborates on these acquisitions, providing financial details and stating that they are expected to enhance Holley's product portfolio.\n6. These references confirm that Holley Inc. did indeed mention mergers and acquisitions in the annual report."
