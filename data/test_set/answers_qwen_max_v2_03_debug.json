The recent full cash exit from Faradion, which followed less than 12 months after the successful OXGENE™ full cash exit, demonstrates a number of key points. We are typically exiting at prices significantly above our holding values - OXGENE at c.£18million above holding value in the previous financial year, and Faradion at c.£14million above the opening holding value in this financial year. These two exits alone generated c.£50million in cash back to our balance sheet, meaning that we are unlikely to come back to our shareholders to ask them for more money to fund the Group's direct investment activities. Being largely comprised of unquoted investments which are not susceptible to stock market volatility, as is currently occurring, we remain confident that our maturing direct investment portfolio will continue to play an important role in increasing NAV per share in the years to come. For more detail on Mercia's financial performance, please refer to Martin Glanfield's Chief Financial Officer review ('CFO'), starting on page 36.\n\n\n## Growing adjusted operating profit\n\nOur commitment to Mercia's recently established progressive dividend policy is underpinned by Mercia's profitable and cash-generative fund management operations, which also enable us to continue to invest in internal system efficiencies and our talented staff. The long-dated nature of our managed funds enables us to have confidence in the sustainability of this dividend policy.\n\nCombined, our direct investment success and our profitable fund management activities are positively contributing to our growing total shareholder return; our annual NAV per share increase plus our dividend yield."

The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125  common  shares  (including  388,082  shares  held  in  treasury)  at  a  purchase  price  of  $12.58  per  share  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  for  a  total  of $101.0 million,  including  $1.0 million  of  transaction  costs. The  $101.0  million  cash  outlay  was reduced  by  $4.9  million  for the  cancellation  of  388,082  of  YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan's (the 'Pension Plan') wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (refer to ' Pension Contributions ' section for additional details).\n\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nOn May 12 th , 2021, the Company's Board modified its dividend policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common shareholders by increasing the dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.15 per share. YP's dividend payout policy and the declaration of dividends on any of the Company's outstanding common shares are subject to the discretion of the Board and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that the dividend payout policy will be maintained or that dividends will be declared. Dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on YP's operations and financial results, subject to the Board's assessment on a quarterly basis, which are, in turn, subject to various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD&A.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share. The dividends were paid on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of 2022 for a total consideration of $14.2 million to common shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.11 per common share on March 15, 2021 and of $0.15 per common share on June 30, September 15 and December 15 of 2021 for a total consideration of $14.7 million to common shareholders.\n\nOn  February  14,  2023,  the  Board  declared  a  cash  dividend  of  $0.15  per  common  share,  payable  on  March  15,  2023  to  shareholders  of  record  as  at February 24, 2023. Future quarterly dividends are subject to Board approval.\n\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n\n(in thousands of Canadian dollars)\n\n\n|                                        | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   | Payments due for the years following December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Total                                                    | 1 year                                                   | 2 - 3 years                                              | 4 - 5 years                                              | Thereafter                                               |\n| Lease obligations 1,2                  | $  47,129                                                | $  3,396                                                 | $  7,675                                                 | $  8,137                                                 | $  27,921                                                |\n| Operating portion of lease obligations | 58,036                                                   | 4,961                                                    | 11,193                                                   | 11,535                                                   | 30,347                                                   |\n| Purchase obligations                   | 32,196                                                   | 14,407                                                   | 12,968                                                   | 2,562                                                    | 2,259                                                    |\n| Total contractual obligations          | $  137,361                                               | $  22,764                                                | $  31,836                                                | $  22,234                                                | $  60,527                                                |\n1 Principal amount.\n2 Net present value.\n\n\n\n## Lease obligations\n\nWe entered into finance lease agreements for premises.

The holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive any dividend declared by the Board of the Company on the common shares. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Yellow Pages, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive, after payment of all liabilities of Yellow Pages and subject to the preferential rights of any class of shares of Yellow Pages ranking in priority to the common shares of Yellow Pages, the remaining assets and property of Yellow Pages.\n\nThe total number of common shares of Yellow Pages Limited held by the trustee for the purpose of funding the restricted share unit and performance share unit plan (the 'RSU and PSU Plan') amounted to 910,912 as at December 31, 2022 (see Note 19 ).\n\nUnder the Stock Option Plan, the maximum number of common shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of options is 2,806,932 (see Note 19 ). During the year ended December 31, 2022, 18,873 common shares were issued upon the exercise of options.\n\n\n## Share repurchases - NCIBs\n\nThe Company entered into a normal course issuer bid ('NCIB'), commencing August 10, 2020, to purchase up to $5.0 million of Common Shares in the open market for cancellation, on or before August 9, 2021. Upon completion of this NCIB on July 16, 2021, the Company had purchased 403,220 common shares for cash of $5.0 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company announced a new NCIB commencing August 10, 2021 to purchase up to $16.0 million of the Company's outstanding shares for cancellation on or before August 9, 2022. Upon completion of this NCIB program on May 30, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program, a total of 1,122,511 common shares for cash of $16.0 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 871,135 common shares, for cash of $12.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 251,376 common shares for cash of $3.6 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares in excess of the repurchase proceeds was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, a $0.6 million financial liability with a corresponding amount in equity, was recorded in Trade and other payables on the consolidated statements of financial position in relation with the NCIB. This liability represented  the value of common shares authorized to be repurchased by a designated broker under an automatic share purchase plan from January 1, 2022 to February 11, 2022. This automatic share purchase plan allowed for the purchase of the Company's common shares under pre-set conditions at times when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. These common shares are included in the outstanding common shares as at December 31, 2021. In 2022, there was no liability as the NCIB was completed.\n\n\n## Share repurchases - Plan of Arrangement\n\nOn August 4, 2022, the Board approved a distribution to shareholders of approximately $100.0 million by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders pursuant to a statutory arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125 common shares  (including    388,082    shares    holder    in    treasury)    at    a    purchase    price    of    $12.58    per    share    pursuant    to    the    Arrangement    for    a    total    of $101.0 million, including $1.0 million of transaction costs. The $101.0 million cash outlay was reduced by $4.9 million for the cancellation of 388,082 of YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Pension Plan's wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (see Note 15 Post-employment benefits for additional details).\n\nIn addition, the Board approved a reduction in the carrying amount of Shareholders' capital of $2,545.0 million in order to reflect the legal stated capital amount at December 31, 2022 of $129.0 million; and the reversal of the amounts previously recognized for Reduction of capital reserves of $2,457.1 million and Other reserves of $112.3 million, with an offset to Deficit. The Reduction of capital and Other reserves were mostly created through multiple transactions over a decade ago and the reversal of these reserves and the reduction in the carrying amount of Shareholders' capital was performed to provide more relevant information about the state of current capital and related reserves to users of these financial statements. There is no impact on total equity, net income, or cash flows."

We believe there is ample opportunity to continue our expansion into new products and markets, such as exterior accessories and mobile electronics, representing a natural progression for us to grow market share as these adjacencies are driven by passionate enthusiasts, consistent with our core categories. See also ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s ' Business and Industry -If  the  Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's new product development.\n\nOn July 16, 2021, we consummated a business combination ('Business Combination') pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021 (the 'Merger Agreement'), by and among Empower Ltd., ('Empower'), Empower Merger Sub I Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub I'), Empower Merger Sub II LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower ('Merger Sub II'), and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdings\"). The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, the following transactions: (i) Merger Sub I merged with and into Holdings, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I ceased, and Holdings became the surviving corporation, and (ii)  Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub II, the separate corporate existence of Holdings ceased, and Merger Sub II became the surviving  limited  liability  company.  Upon  closing,  Empower  changed  its  name  to  Holley  Inc.  and  its  trading  symbol  on  the  New  York  Stock Exchange (the 'NYSE') from 'EMPW' to 'HLLY.'\n\n\n## Business Strategy\n\n\nOur  vision  is  to  be  the  most  compelling  and  inclusive  platform  for  automotive  enthusiasts,  to  inspire  and  support  enthusiasts'  transition  to cleaner, more sustainable technologies, and to further accelerate the automotive lifestyle. Our aim is to provide a platform where automotive enthusiasts can purchase aftermarket auto parts for both old model restorations and new vehicle enhancements. We believe our consumers are enthusiastic and passionate about the performance and the personalization of their classic and modern cars. We aim to provide the products and service they need to pursue that passion. We will continue to drive growth and value for our shareholders through our key strategies:\n- · Continuous  New  Product  Development: New  products  allow  us  to  increase  market  share  in  existing  categories,  extend  into adjacent categories, capture new enthusiast consumers and extend or further penetrate new vehicle platforms. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -If the Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's new product development.\n- · Accelerate Growth Through Continued M&A : We have historically used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio, enter new product categories and consumer segments, and expand share in current product categories. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that complement our current business and expand our addressable target market. We believe that our scalable business platform, relationships with our distribution and channel partners, strong loyalty with our growing consumer base, and experienced management team and board of directors, position us to realize the benefits from the integration of recent acquisitions and prime us for future acquisitions. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -The Company may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert  the  Company  management s  attention,  result  in  dilution  to  the  Company  stockholders,  and  otherwise  disrupt  the  Company ' operations and harm the Company business, sales, financial condition and results of operations ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's M&A activity.\n- · Expand Direct-to-Consumer ( DTC ) Sales and Further Engage with Our Consumers: ' ' We are highly focused on deepening our engagement with our enthusiast consumers and selling them products through our fast-growing online platform. We have multiple touch points in our consumer ecosystem, ranging from social media to our website, to our many in-person enthusiast events. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -If the Company s plans to increase sales through its DTC channel ' are not successful, the Company s business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed ' ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's DTC channel.\n\n\n\n## Competition\n\nThe performance automotive industry is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all the markets that we serve. The principal factors  on  which  industry  participants  compete  include  technical  features,  performance,  product  design,  innovation,  reliability  and  durability, brand, time to market, customer service, reliable order execution, and price. Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability to execute our Business Strategy discussed above.\n\nThe performance automotive aftermarket parts industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. In addition, we have seen consistent growth within the automotive aftermarket parts industry over the last two decades. Products in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry range from functional products that enhance vehicle performance to products that improve safety, stability, handling and appearance."

          "chunk_text": "# Table of Contents\n\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nHolley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company's geographic  presence,  provide  a  highly  synergistic  opportunity  and/or  enhance  Holley's  ability  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  its  products  to  its customers through its distribution network.\n\n\nFrom  2020  through  2022,  Holley  completed  15  acquisitions.  The  most  significant  of  these  acquisitions  impacting  the  comparability  of  our operating results were:\n- · Baer, Inc. : On December 23, 2021, Holley acquired Baer, Inc. doing business as Baer Brakes, a developer and supplier of brakes and brake systems. This acquisition moves Holley closer to its goals of providing complete vehicle solutions by adding a new product category and brake system expertise.\n- · Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc. : On December 16, 2021, Holley acquired Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., doing business as Brothers Trucks, a distributor of Classic and Custom vehicle restoration parts serving the Chevrolet and GMC truck aftermarket. This acquisition increases Holley's offering in truck and SUV appearance items.\n- · Advance Engine Management Inc. : On April 14, 2021, Holley acquired Advance Engine Management Inc., doing business as AEM Performance  Electronics,  a  developer  and  supplier  of  electronic  control  and  monitoring  systems  for  performance  automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley's penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.\n- · Simpson  Performance  Products: On  November  16,  2020,  Holley  acquired  Simpson  Performance  Products,  Inc.  ('Simpson'),  a designer  and  seller  of  motorsport  safety  products  including  helmets  head  &  neck  restraints,  seat  belts,  fire  suits  and  more.  This acquisition extended Holley's footprint into the safety and racing segment.\n- · Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020, Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC ('Drake'), a designer and seller of automotive  aftermarket  appearance  parts,  wheels,  chassis  &  suspension  products  and  accessories.  This  acquisition  increases Holley's penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.\n\n\nThe  acquisitions  have  all  been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  Accounting  Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805, Business Combinations , and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, ' Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,'  and  Note  2,  ' Business Combination and Acquisitions ,'  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n\n\n## Business Environment\n\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has continued to experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full  extent  of  COVID-19's  effect  on  the  Company's  operational  and  financial  performance  in  the  future  will  depend  on  future  developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.\n\nThe  Company's  business  and  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity  are  impacted  by  broad  economic  conditions  including inflation, labor shortages, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine. The Company's operations have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures primarily related to transportation, labor and component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary impacts, the Company has attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products and working closely with its suppliers and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  The  Company's  profitability  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increased our  costs.  Should  the  ongoing  macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate the impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected."

          "chunk_text": "The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This determination was primarily based  on  the  Holley  Stockholder  having  a  relative  majority  of  the  voting  power  of  the  Company,  the  operations  of  Holley  prior  to  the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Company, and senior management of Holley comprising the majority of the senior management of the Company. Under this method of accounting, Empower was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting. Accordingly,  the  Business  Combination  was  accounted  for  as  the  equivalent  of  Holley  issuing  stock  for  the  net  assets  of  Empower, accompanied by a recapitalization. The  net  assets  of  Empower  are  stated  at  historical  cost,  with  no  goodwill  or  other  intangible  assets recorded.  Reported  amounts  from  operations  included  herein  prior  to  the  Business  Combination  are  those  of  Holley  Intermediate.  The shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated based on shares received by the Holley Stockholder.\n\nThe following table reconciles the elements of the Business Combination to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n|                                                                                                  | Recapitalization   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Cash - Empower's trust and cash (net of redemptions of $99,353 and transaction costs of $44,314) | $ 107,017          |\n| Cash - Forward Purchase Agreement                                                                | 50,000             |\n| Cash - PIPE Financing                                                                            | 240,000            |\n| Net cash provided by Business Combination and PIPE Financing                                     | 397,017            |\n| Less: cash consideration paid to Holley Stockholder                                              | (264,718)          |\n| Net contributions from Business Combination and PIPE Financing                                   | $ 132,299          |\n\n\n\n## ACQUISITIONS\n\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed 14 acquisitions. These acquisitions are expected to enhance the Company's portfolio of products and services in the automotive aftermarket and automotive safety solutions market.\n\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated based upon the  fair  value  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  The  valuation  of  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  is  subject  to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, material changes are not expected. Goodwill generated by the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the strong market position of the entities acquired.\n\nPurchase price consideration for all acquisitions was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions were for 100 percent of the acquired business and  are  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  net  of  acquired  cash  and  cash  equivalents. Acquisition-related  costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other costs, are typically expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and are recorded in acquisition and restructuring costs. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\nIn 2022, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of John's Ind., Inc. (\"John's\"), Southern Kentucky Classics (\"SKC\"), and Vesta Motorsports USA, Inc., doing business as RaceQuip (\"RaceQuip\"). These acquisitions were immaterial business combinations. Cash paid for the three acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $14,863, and was funded with borrowings from the Company's credit facility and cash on  hand.  The  acquisitions  resulted  in  both  amortizable  and  nonamortizable  intangibles  and  goodwill  totaling  $9,618.  The  goodwill  and intangibles  generated  as  a  result  of  these  acquisitions  are  deductible  for  income  tax  purposes.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  and  the results of operations since the acquisition dates for these immaterial acquisitions have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate."

To answer this, I need to look for explicit mentions of mergers, acquisitions, or related activities such as purchases of companies, integration of businesses, or similar transactions.\n3. Reviewing the provided pages, there is no explicit mention of mergers or acquisitions. Page 9 discusses increasing funds under management through fund mandates, fundraising, and M&A but does not provide specific details about actual mergers or acquisitions carried out during the year.\n4. Other sections, including financial statements and risk discussions, do not reference completed mergers or acquisitions either.\n5. Therefore, while M&A is listed as a strategy for growth, there is no evidence of specific transactions being announced or completed.",

Operating margin is calculated as Operating Income divided by Revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n2. **Context Examination:** The provided pages include financial data such as revenue, net profit, and other metrics, but there is no explicit mention of 'Operating Income' or a breakdown that would allow us to calculate it indirectly.\n3. **Metric Matching:** While revenue figures are available (e.g., page 98, Tradition-ICAP revenue of CHF 56,861,000 in 2022), there is no clear reference to operating income or a similar metric that could be used to compute the operating margin.\n4. **Value Extraction and Adjustment:** Without the necessary components to calculate operating margin (i.e., operating income and revenue for the same segment or consolidated entity), it is not possible to derive the requested value.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the required data to compute or directly identify the operating margin is absent, the answer must be 'N/A'.",
      "reasoning_summary": "The annual report lacks explicit data on operating income or a similar metric needed to calculate the operating margin. Revenue figures are present, but insufficient alone to determine the operating margin.",

      "step_by_step_analysis": "1. The question asks whether TSX_Y (Yellow Pages Limited) announced a share buyback plan in the annual report.\n2. A 'share buyback plan' refers to a company's initiative to repurchase its own shares, typically to reduce the number of outstanding shares or return capital to shareholders.\n3. On page 20 and page 68, there is mention of a Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) program. Specifically, an NCIB was announced on August 5, 2021, to purchase up to $16.0 million worth of shares, with purchases completed by May 30, 2022. Additionally, details about share repurchases under this NCIB are provided for both 2021 and 2022.\n4. Furthermore, on page 20, there is mention of a statutory plan of arrangement approved by shareholders on September 23, 2022, which involved a significant share repurchase from all shareholders on a pro rata basis for $100.0 million.\n5. Both the NCIB and the plan of arrangement qualify as share buyback initiatives.\n6. Therefore, Yellow Pages Limited did announce and execute share buyback plans during the reporting period covered by the annual report.",
      "reasoning_summary": "The annual report explicitly mentions two share buyback initiatives: (1) an NCIB program launched in August 2021 and completed in May 2022, and (2) a statutory plan of arrangement executed in October 2022. These clearly demonstrate that the company announced and implemented share buyback plans.",

This requires identifying specific figures related to executive compensation from the provided documents.\n2. Reviewing the content, there is no explicit mention of a singular largest spending amount on executive compensation. The documents primarily discuss financial performance, operational activities, and general descriptions of executive roles without detailing individual compensation amounts.\n3. Some sections, such as the Consolidated Statements of Operations (page 65) and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (page 68), provide extensive financial data but do not break down executive compensation specifically.\n4. The section on exhibits (page 113) references employment agreements with executives like Mike Maddox, Benjamin R. Clouse, and others, but does not specify monetary values for these agreements.\n5. Without explicit figures or further detailed breakdowns in the provided excerpts, it is impossible to determine the largest single spending on executive compensation based solely on the given information.",
      "reasoning_summary": "The provided excerpts lack specific details or figures regarding executive compensation spending. While employment agreements and executive roles are mentioned, no explicit monetary values are provided that would allow identification of the largest single spending on executive compensation.",

To answer this, we need to look for explicit references to mergers, acquisitions, or business combinations within the provided text.\n3. On page 6, the report mentions a 'Business Combination' that occurred on July 16, 2021, involving Empower Ltd., Empower Merger Sub I Inc., Empower Merger Sub II LLC, and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. This is described as a significant transaction where Empower changed its name to Holley Inc.\n4. Additionally, pages 34 and 64 provide detailed information about multiple acquisitions completed by Holley between 2020 and 2022. For example, acquisitions of companies like Baer Brakes, Brothers Trucks, AEM Performance Electronics, and others are explicitly listed.\n5. Page 64 also describes how these acquisitions were accounted for under U.S. GAAP and their impact on the company’s financials.\n6. Therefore, there are clear mentions of both mergers (the Business Combination) and acquisitions throughout the document.",
      "reasoning_summary": "The annual report explicitly discusses a major 'Business Combination' involving Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc., which qualifies as a merger. It also provides extensive details about numerous acquisitions completed during the reporting period. These sections confirm that Holley Inc. did indeed mention mergers and acquisitions in the annual report.",
