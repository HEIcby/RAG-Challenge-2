For our direct portfolio, IRR is adopted as our proprietary capital is also used for other activities. As at 31 March 2022, the direct portfolio IRR had increased to c.16%, largely following the successful sale of Faradion.\n\nWe measure 'Total Value to Paid In' ('TVPI') across our Regional and Private Equity ('PE') funds as it shows total value returned and accruing to investors after fees; this naturally increases over time as more capital is returned and the portfolio values grow. Our legacy Venture funds, at a TVPI of 193%, are significantly up year on year as a number of assets were sold at higher values during FY22. Our newest PE fund saw a recovery in asset values as the impact of the pandemic on its portfolio businesses began to recede.\n\nFor our VCTs, 'total return' includes cumulative dividends paid alongside current asset value to give a true total performance measure. It has been principally flat year on year due to sharp price weakness across the listed part of the VCT portfolios in the final quarter of the financial year.\n\nOur strong overall investment performance enables us to raise additional funds, and we were allocated a further £31.4million this financial year from additional contributions to the Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund ('NPIF') Equity and Debt funds and our Midlands Engine Investment Fund ('MEIF') Proof of Concept and Early Stage Fund by BBB. Alongside this, our Enterprise Investment Scheme ('EIS') team raised new funds totalling c.£16million, in addition to Northern VCT investors re-investing c.£6million of dividends paid during the year. Since year end, £40.0million of new funds were raised by our Northern VCTs, together with c.£5million raised by our first Knowledge-intensive Impact EIS Fund. At the year end, we had c.£297million of liquidity across all our funds and balance sheet.\n\n\n| Asset class         |   AuM   1 April 2021  £'m | Private Investor inflows  £'m   | Public Sector inflows  £'m   | Performance  £'m   | Distributions  £'m   |   AuM   31 March 2022  £'m | Post  year end  inflows  £'m   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Venture             |                       600 | 22                              | 20                           | 30                 | (80)                 |                        592 | 45                             |\n| Private Equity      |                        54 | -                               | -                            | (2)                | (4)                  |                         48 | -                              |\n| Debt                |                       110 | -                               | 11                           | -                  | (3)                  |                        118 | -                              |\n| Total FuM           |                       764 | 22                              | 31                           | 28                 | (87)                 |                        758 | 45                             |\n| Proprietary Capital |                       176 | -                               | -                            | 28                 | (3)                  |                        201 | -                              |\n| Total AuM           |                       940 | 22                              | 31                           | 56                 | (90)                 |                        959 | 45                             |"

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Mercia Asset Management PLC mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. To determine this, we need to look for explicit references to mergers, acquisitions, or related activities such as purchases of companies, integration of new entities, or similar transactions.\n3. On page 9, under 'Other key objectives,' there is a mention of 'To increase funds under management ('FuM') through increased fund mandates, fund raising activities and mergers and acquisitions ('M&A').' This indicates that M&A is part of their strategy but does not confirm specific transactions.\n4. No other pages explicitly mention completed mergers or acquisitions. While M&A is listed as a strategic objective, there is no evidence of actual deals being announced or executed in the report."

OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nThe presentation of the Group's operating segments reflects information provided internally to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. He analyses the management reports in order to assess performances and allocate resources to the various operating segments.\n\nThe Group's internal organisation and management structure is based on a geographical approach. Management information is grouped into three geographic regions - Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific - and comprises broadly similar products and services. The geographical approach is based mainly on the location of the Group's offices and operating teams.\n\nSegment performance is assessed and resource allocation is decided on the basis of an evaluation of the operating results, which differ in certain respects from the operating result presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nThe accounting policies applied in evaluating the segment operating results are identical to those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:\n- Segment reporting on joint ventures includes the Group's share in the assets, liabilities, revenue -and results of these companies.\n- Revenue from matched principal activities is recognised at the transaction date instead of the -delivery date of securities.\n- Interest expense recognised on lease liabilities is presented under rental expense and -recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n\nCertain operating expenses related to the Group's holding companies are presented separately from the operating segments. Moreover, some items considered exceptional, such as gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries or associates, depreciation of property and equipment, or restructuring charges, are not included in operating segment results.\n\nRevenues generated by operating segments are derived from three major products groups, which present broadly similar profitability profiles or transaction methods. All Compagnie Financière Tradition's historical broking activities, in the money markets, spot and forward forex trading, interest rate derivatives and currency options, are grouped under 'Currencies and interest rates'. 'Securities and security derivatives' include interest rate futures operations, sovereign and corporate bond trading, equities and equity derivatives trading in OTC and regulated markets, repo transactions, and credit derivatives broking. Finally, 'Commodities and other activities' comprises broking activities in energy, precious metals and environmental products, as well as activities catering to retail customers via specialised forex trading platforms in Asia.\n\nRevenue only includes income from transactions with external customers. No transactions between operating segments impact revenue.\n\n\n## A N N U A L   R E P O R T"

It also continued to update and alter guidance on consumer remediation to encourage license-holding organisations to operate more efficiently, honestly and fairly. It released two reports detailing the standards of practice within wholesale financial markets, and announced its enforcement priorities for 2023, which include enforcement action on greenwashing, prosecuting predatory lending, and intervening in investment scams.\n\n\n# NEW ZEALAND\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) finalised the Financial Markets Infrastructure regulatory framework. The FMA published an information sheet on Record Keeping for Financial Advice Providers (FAPs) to help FAPs to demonstrate compliance with their record keeping obligations. A second information sheet on Cyber Security and Operational Systems Resilience was published to assist market services licensees to enhance the resilience of their technology and operational systems and meet any relevant license obligations. In addition, the FMA opened consultation on standard conditions for financial institution licenses.\n\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\nThe level of activity at the start of 2023 continued along the lines of last year, growing more than 10% from January to mid-March compared with the same period in 2022 at constant exchange rates, driven by central bank monetary tightening policy to combat stubborn inflation. Compagnie Financière Tradition will pursue its growth strategy and cost discipline, while maintaining investment in its data and analytics activities and hybrid broking capabilities.\n\n\n## Operating Review"

Operating margin is typically calculated as (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100.\n2. **Context Examination:** The provided pages include financial data such as revenues, net profits, and other metrics, but there is no explicit mention of 'Operating Income' or a directly labeled 'Operating margin'.\n3. **Metric Matching:** While revenue figures are available (e.g., page 98 shows revenues for Tradition-ICAP and Tradition Energy), there is no clear reporting of 'Operating Income', which is necessary to compute the operating margin.\n4. **Value Extraction and Adjustment:** Without the operating income figure, it is impossible to calculate the operating margin. The context lacks sufficient information to derive this metric.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the required data to compute or directly identify the operating margin is not present, the answer must be 'N/A'."

The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125  common  shares  (including  388,082  shares  held  in  treasury)  at  a  purchase  price  of  $12.58  per  share  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  for  a  total  of $101.0 million,  including  $1.0 million  of  transaction  costs. The  $101.0  million  cash  outlay  was reduced  by  $4.9  million  for the  cancellation  of  388,082  of  YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan's (the 'Pension Plan') wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (refer to ' Pension Contributions ' section for additional details).\n\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nOn May 12 th , 2021, the Company's Board modified its dividend policy of paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common shareholders by increasing the dividend from $0.11 per share to $0.15 per share. YP's dividend payout policy and the declaration of dividends on any of the Company's outstanding common shares are subject to the discretion of the Board and, consequently, there can be no guarantee that the dividend payout policy will be maintained or that dividends will be declared. Dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on YP's operations and financial results, subject to the Board's assessment on a quarterly basis, which are, in turn, subject to various assumptions and risks, including those set out in this MD&A.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share.

          "chunk_text": "# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2022\n\n\n# (all tabular amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, except share information)\n\nYellow Pages is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.\n\nThe holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to one vote per common share at all meetings of shareholders of the Company. The holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive any dividend declared by the Board of the Company on the common shares. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Yellow Pages, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the common shares of Yellow Pages are entitled to receive, after payment of all liabilities of Yellow Pages and subject to the preferential rights of any class of shares of Yellow Pages ranking in priority to the common shares of Yellow Pages, the remaining assets and property of Yellow Pages.\n\nThe total number of common shares of Yellow Pages Limited held by the trustee for the purpose of funding the restricted share unit and performance share unit plan (the 'RSU and PSU Plan') amounted to 910,912 as at December 31, 2022 (see Note 19 ).\n\nUnder the Stock Option Plan, the maximum number of common shares authorized for issuance upon the exercise of options is 2,806,932 (see Note 19 ). During the year ended December 31, 2022, 18,873 common shares were issued upon the exercise of options.\n\n\n## Share repurchases - NCIBs\n\nThe Company entered into a normal course issuer bid ('NCIB'), commencing August 10, 2020, to purchase up to $5.0 million of Common Shares in the open market for cancellation, on or before August 9, 2021. Upon completion of this NCIB on July 16, 2021, the Company had purchased 403,220 common shares for cash of $5.0 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company announced a new NCIB commencing August 10, 2021 to purchase up to $16.0 million of the Company's outstanding shares for cancellation on or before August 9, 2022. Upon completion of this NCIB program on May 30, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program, a total of 1,122,511 common shares for cash of $16.0 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 871,135 common shares, for cash of $12.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased under this NCIB program 251,376 common shares for cash of $3.6 million. The related historical carrying value of these shares in excess of the repurchase proceeds was reclassified from shareholder's capital to deficit.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, a $0.6 million financial liability with a corresponding amount in equity, was recorded in Trade and other payables on the consolidated statements of financial position in relation with the NCIB. This liability represented  the value of common shares authorized to be repurchased by a designated broker under an automatic share purchase plan from January 1, 2022 to February 11, 2022. This automatic share purchase plan allowed for the purchase of the Company's common shares under pre-set conditions at times when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted due to regulatory restrictions or self-imposed blackout periods. These common shares are included in the outstanding common shares as at December 31, 2021. In 2022, there was no liability as the NCIB was completed.\n\n\n## Share repurchases - Plan of Arrangement\n\nOn August 4, 2022, the Board approved a distribution to shareholders of approximately $100.0 million by way of a share repurchase from all shareholders pursuant to a statutory arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The shareholders of the Company (the 'Shareholders') approved the Arrangement at a special meeting of the Shareholders held on September 23, 2022 and the Company subsequently obtained the final order from the Supreme Court of British Columbia approving the Arrangement on September 27, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company repurchased from shareholders pro rata an aggregate of 7,949,125 common shares  (including    388,082    shares    holder    in    treasury)    at    a    purchase    price    of    $12.58    per    share    pursuant    to    the    Arrangement    for    a    total    of $101.0 million, including $1.0 million of transaction costs. The $101.0 million cash outlay was reduced by $4.9 million for the cancellation of 388,082 of YP's 1,298,994 shares held in Treasury for a net cash outlay of $96.1 million. Also pursuant to the Arrangement, the Company advanced $24.0 million to the Pension Plan's wind-up deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 (see Note 15 Post-employment benefits for additional details).\n\nIn addition, the Board approved a reduction in the carrying amount of Shareholders' capital of $2,545.0 million in order to reflect the legal stated capital amount at December 31, 2022 of $129.0 million; and the reversal of the amounts previously recognized for Reduction of capital reserves of $2,457.1 million and Other reserves of $112.3 million, with an offset to Deficit. The Reduction of capital and Other reserves were mostly created through multiple transactions over a decade ago and the reversal of these reserves and the reduction in the carrying amount of Shareholders' capital was performed to provide more relevant information about the state of current capital and related reserves to users of these financial statements. There is no impact on total equity, net income, or cash flows."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether TSX_Y (Yellow Pages Limited) announced a share buyback plan in the annual report.\n2. A 'share buyback plan' refers to a company's initiative to repurchase its own shares, typically for cancellation or to hold in treasury. Such plans are often disclosed in financial reports under sections like 'Share Repurchases' or 'Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB).'\n3. In the retrieved context, there are multiple mentions of NCIBs and share repurchases:\n   - On page 68, it states that the Company entered into an NCIB commencing August 10, 2020, to purchase up to $5.0 million of Common Shares, which was completed on July 16, 2021.\n   - Another NCIB was announced on August 5, 2021, to purchase up to $16.0 million of outstanding shares, completed on May 30, 2022. Details about purchases under this program are provided for both 2021 and 2022.\n   - Additionally, on page 20, the report discusses a significant share repurchase event under a 'Plan of Arrangement,' where the Company repurchased 7,949,125 common shares for $101.0 million on October 4, 2022.\n4. These disclosures confirm that Yellow Pages Limited announced and executed multiple share buyback initiatives during the reporting period."

Upon  closing,  Empower  changed  its  name  to  Holley  Inc.  and  its  trading  symbol  on  the  New  York  Stock Exchange (the 'NYSE') from 'EMPW' to 'HLLY.'\n\n\n## Business Strategy\n\n\nOur  vision  is  to  be  the  most  compelling  and  inclusive  platform  for  automotive  enthusiasts,  to  inspire  and  support  enthusiasts'  transition  to cleaner, more sustainable technologies, and to further accelerate the automotive lifestyle. Our aim is to provide a platform where automotive enthusiasts can purchase aftermarket auto parts for both old model restorations and new vehicle enhancements. We believe our consumers are enthusiastic and passionate about the performance and the personalization of their classic and modern cars. We aim to provide the products and service they need to pursue that passion. We will continue to drive growth and value for our shareholders through our key strategies:\n- · Continuous  New  Product  Development: New  products  allow  us  to  increase  market  share  in  existing  categories,  extend  into adjacent categories, capture new enthusiast consumers and extend or further penetrate new vehicle platforms. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -If the Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's new product development.\n- · Accelerate Growth Through Continued M&A : We have historically used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio, enter new product categories and consumer segments, and expand share in current product categories. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that complement our current business and expand our addressable target market. We believe that our scalable business platform, relationships with our distribution and channel partners, strong loyalty with our growing consumer base, and experienced management team and board of directors, position us to realize the benefits from the integration of recent acquisitions and prime us for future acquisitions. See ' Risk Factors -Risks Relating to Holley s Business and Industry ' -The Company may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert  the  Company  management s  attention,  result  in  dilution  to  the  Company  stockholders,  and  otherwise  disrupt  the  Company ' operations and harm the Company business, sales, financial condition and results of operations ' for a discussion of the risks related to the Company's M&A activity.\n- · Expand Direct-to-Consumer ( DTC ) Sales and Further Engage with Our Consumers: ' ' We are highly focused on deepening our engagement with our enthusiast consumers and selling them products through our fast-growing online platform.

The principal factors  on  which  industry  participants  compete  include  technical  features,  performance,  product  design,  innovation,  reliability  and  durability, brand, time to market, customer service, reliable order execution, and price. Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability to execute our Business Strategy discussed above.\n\nThe performance automotive aftermarket parts industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. In addition, we have seen consistent growth within the automotive aftermarket parts industry over the last two decades. Products in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry range from functional products that enhance vehicle performance to products that improve safety, stability, handling and appearance."

          "chunk_text": "# Table of Contents\n\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nHolley has historically pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. The Company has pursued acquisitions that it believes will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. Holley targets companies that are market leaders, expand the Company's geographic  presence,  provide  a  highly  synergistic  opportunity  and/or  enhance  Holley's  ability  to  provide  a  wide  array  of  its  products  to  its customers through its distribution network.\n\n\nFrom  2020  through  2022,  Holley  completed  15  acquisitions.  The  most  significant  of  these  acquisitions  impacting  the  comparability  of  our operating results were:\n- · Baer, Inc. : On December 23, 2021, Holley acquired Baer, Inc. doing business as Baer Brakes, a developer and supplier of brakes and brake systems. This acquisition moves Holley closer to its goals of providing complete vehicle solutions by adding a new product category and brake system expertise.\n- · Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc. : On December 16, 2021, Holley acquired Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., doing business as Brothers Trucks, a distributor of Classic and Custom vehicle restoration parts serving the Chevrolet and GMC truck aftermarket. This acquisition increases Holley's offering in truck and SUV appearance items.\n- · Advance Engine Management Inc. : On April 14, 2021, Holley acquired Advance Engine Management Inc., doing business as AEM Performance  Electronics,  a  developer  and  supplier  of  electronic  control  and  monitoring  systems  for  performance  automotive applications. This acquisition increases Holley's penetration into the import and other sport compact cars submarket.\n- · Simpson  Performance  Products: On  November  16,  2020,  Holley  acquired  Simpson  Performance  Products,  Inc.  ('Simpson'),  a designer  and  seller  of  motorsport  safety  products  including  helmets  head  &  neck  restraints,  seat  belts,  fire  suits  and  more.  This acquisition extended Holley's footprint into the safety and racing segment.\n- · Drake Automotive Group: On November 11, 2020, Holley acquired Drake Automotive Group LLC ('Drake'), a designer and seller of automotive  aftermarket  appearance  parts,  wheels,  chassis  &  suspension  products  and  accessories.  This  acquisition  increases Holley's penetration within the Ford/Mustang platform where it has historically been under indexed relative to the market.\n\n\nThe  acquisitions  have  all  been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  Accounting  Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805, Business Combinations , and the operations of the acquired entities are included in our historical results for the periods following the closing of the acquisition. See Note 1, ' Description of the Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,'  and  Note  2,  ' Business Combination and Acquisitions ,'  in  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Company's acquisitions and investments.\n\n\n## Business Environment\n\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted global supply chain and general economic conditions. The Company has continued to experience disruptions and higher costs in manufacturing, supply chain, logistical operations, and shortages of certain Company products in distribution channels. The full  extent  of  COVID-19's  effect  on  the  Company's  operational  and  financial  performance  in  the  future  will  depend  on  future  developments, including but not limited to the duration, spread, intensity and phase of the pandemic in various countries; the emergence of COVID-19 variants and the utilization and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines against these variants; the further impact of COVID-19 on the global economy; and demand for the Company's products and services. Should the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate its impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. See Part I: Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business.\n\nThe  Company's  business  and  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity  are  impacted  by  broad  economic  conditions  including inflation, labor shortages, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by geopolitical events, specifically the conflict in Ukraine. The Company's operations have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures primarily related to transportation, labor and component costs. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by continuing supply chain challenges and automotive electronic component shortages. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary impacts, the Company has attempted to minimize potential adverse impacts on its business with cost savings initiatives, price increases to customers, and by increasing inventory levels of certain products and working closely with its suppliers and  customers  to  minimize  disruptions  in  delivering  products  to  customers.  The  Company's  profitability  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be, adversely affected by constrained consumer demand, a shift in sales to lower-margin products, and demands on our performance that increased our  costs.  Should  the  ongoing  macroeconomic conditions not improve, or worsen, or if the Company's attempt to mitigate the impact on its supply chain, operations and costs is not successful, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected."

Additionally, on page 34, there is a section titled 'Acquisitions' which lists multiple acquisitions made by Holley from 2020 through 2022, including Baer, Inc., Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., Advance Engine Management Inc., Simpson Performance Products, and Drake Automotive Group.\n5. Furthermore, on page 5, under 'About Us,' Holley mentions expanding its brand lineup through a series of strategic acquisitions, specifically naming acquisitions such as AEM Performance Electronics, Classic Instruments LLC, and others.\n6. These references confirm that Holley Inc. did indeed mention mergers and acquisitions in the annual report."
